        <p>The Solar System consists of the Sun and everything that orbits it, including planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and other celestial bodies. 
            Earth is one of the eight planets in the Solar System, and it orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 93 million miles
            (150 million kilometers).
            <br>
            The Solar System formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a giant cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula. <br>
            Over time, gravity caused the material in the nebula to clump together, eventually forming the Sun and the planets.
            <br>
            <br>
            The inner planets, including Earth, are rocky planets with solid surfaces. 
            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and is the only known planet to support life. 
            It has a unique atmosphere that contains oxygen, water, and other gases necessary for life.</p>
